# Kafka Topics

The Kafka Topics are described in the following files:

* ```topics/greetings-topic.yml```: Sample topic to be used by the sample application
* ```topics/greetings-reversed-topic.yml```: Sample topic to be used by the sample streams application
* ```topics/logs-topic.yml```: Topic to store logs
* ```topics/metrics-topic.yml```: Topic to store metrics

You can deploy or update the topics with the following command:

```shell
oc apply -f topics/
```

This command will show the status of the Kafka Topics:

```shell
‚ùØ oc get kt

monitor.ocp.metrics               event-bus   10           3                    True
